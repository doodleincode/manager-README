# Hi, I'm Daniel!

I'm looking forward to getting to know you! This document is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me. This document is not intended to replace or override the mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## A little bit about me

* I've been a software developer for quite some time (since 2006), though a day rarely goes by without learning something new.
* I love cars and do most maintenance and repairs myself.
* I love snowboarding.
* I believe in the [Servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) model. As your manager, I'm here to make sure you are both successful and happy.

## My role

* Piggy backing off the last bullet from above, I'm here to make sure you are both successful and happy. I want to help you improve your technical skills, grow your career, and enjoy your work.
* We (the Dev Team leadership) are here to help make sure we are working on the right things, which is not necessarily everything we're asked to do.
* I write code too! I specialize in authentication and authorization.

In general, my role is not to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it. This isn't to say we can't brainstorm together and bounce ideas off each other, but rather you are empowered to make decisions as you work with the rest of the team.

## Feedback

If you have feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something else that doesn't fit in any of these categories.

You can provide this feedback in whichever method is most comfortable for you: Zoom (face-to-face or voice), Teams, or email.

Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member or colleague, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, let's chat and I can either get the feedback to them or we can figure out a way to deliver it that makes you comfortable.

## 1:1's

Initially, I will put thirty minutes on your calendar each week for a one-on-one. In our first 1:1, I will ask what day/time works best for you going forward and do my best to accommodate.

1:1's are your time and should be led by you, and not me, meaning the topics should largely be driven by you. I will probably have some things to discuss with you as needed, but this may not necessarily be every week. This is first and foremost your opportunity to let me know how you're doing, what you need, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and your teammates, what your career goals are, etc.

## Performance

I will strive to give you feedback on how you're doing continuously, including in our 1:1's. If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know. My goal is for you to never be unsure about how you're performing (and how I think you're performing). If you ever feel unsure about either of these things, please let me know.

## Communicating with me

I work entirely remotely, and my normal hours are 8:30am to 5:30pm, though this can vary somewhat. If I'm not available during my normal hours, I will mark it in my Teams status and on my calendar.

### If you need something

1. Send a chat on Teams or set up an impromptu Zoom meeting.
2. If you want to schedule something in advance, throw something on my calendar.

## In closing, a caveat

If I'm your manager and something here seems off or is missing something that you wished you had known, please let me know! Bring it up in our 1:1 or ping me on Teams.
